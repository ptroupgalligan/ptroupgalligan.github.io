            <h2>My education!</h2>
            <p>I attended elementary, middle, and high school in Oakland, CA at Head Royce School. After graduating in 
                2019 I began college at UC Berkeley, intending to study biology. However, after my first semester, 
                I determined that I would rather study computer science and switched majors. I just finished the end of
                my senior year and finishing off my degree requirements over the summer.</p>
